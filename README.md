# Veil – Product & Engineering Execution

I am a solo founder and engineer who built Veil end-to-end as a fully working system.

## What I built
- Backend + database + infrastructure (production)
- Telegram bot + WebApp
- Android game integrated with backend and bot
- Reward system, user progression, payments, syncing

Everything was designed, implemented, deployed, and operated by me.

## Live system
- Telegram bot: (https://t.me/VeilDropBot)
- WebApp: https://veil-drop-bot-2.vercel.app/
- Android build / demo: (https://www.loom.com/share/c65acb0477a7427f9eb747036ccbcdce)

## Tech stack
- Backend: Python
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Infra: cloud-hosted, production deployment
- Frontend: WebApp + Unity (Android)

## Proof of execution
- Live users interacting with the system
- Payments implemented and working
- Multiple production deployments
- System designed and maintained by a single engineer

This is not a concept or prototype — it is a running product.
